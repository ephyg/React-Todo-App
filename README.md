## **React:**
I have used the React library to create a user interface for your todo app that allows users to create, read, update, and delete todo items. Users can add new items to the list, edit existing items and delete items from the list. 

## **Firebase:** 
I have used Firebase as your backend for your todo app. Firebase is a platform that provides a variety of backend services, including authentication, real-time databases, and cloud storage.
